# Predicting NCLEX Outcomes with the ATI Comprehensive Predictor

---


class: inverse

# The problem:

.xlarge[
- No process was in place to consistently collect NCLEX pass/fail data from students

- Most recent studies on CP validity were out of date with small samples
  + RN: 2013, N = 947
  + PN: 2014, N = 337
]

---

class: inverse

# Main issues:

.xlarge[
- Data quality

- Representativeness of sample

- Ability to match NCLEX outcome data back to CP scores
]

---


#Past efforts:

.large[
- Spring 2017: Survey included at end of CP to get student consent

- Institutions contacted to provide data on their students

- Low response rates & difficulty matching records

- Only Q2 testers - not representative

- Just 316 records collected
]

---

class: inverse

# My solution:

.xxlarge[
Step 1: Attach survey to end of Comprehensive Predictor
]

.xlarge[
- Opt in or out of data collection & provide email

- Data stored in database
]

---

class: inverse

# My solution:

.xxlarge[
Step 2: Query to get a list of those who opted in
]

.xlarge[
- Filter based on date

- Clean data & format for Qualtrics upload
]

---

class: inverse

# My solution:

.xxlarge[
Step 3: Single-question follow-up via Qualtrics
]

.xlarge[
- Yes/No/Not yet taken

- Embedded in email - just one click!

- Incentivized to drive response rate
]

---

#Results so far (RN)

.xlarge[
- 49.6% response rate (!)

- 8,095 Y/N responses

- 3,141 after resampling

# Creating the expectancy table

.xlarge[
- Data integration via Qualtrics API

- Pull dataset, resample, estimate logistic regression

- Output: Expectancy table, formatted report with information
